## üöÄ What This Project Does

The Pinecone Query Agent transforms natural language queries into sophisticated vector database searches by:

1. **Natural Language Processing**: Takes your plain English questions and understands what you're looking for
2. **Dual Query Generation**: Creates both semantic embeddings and metadata filters from your input
3. **Intelligent Filtering**: Automatically extracts filters like author names, publication dates, and tags
4. **Vector Search**: Performs similarity searches using sentence transformers
5. **Results Display**: Presents matching results with complete metadata in an intuitive interface

## üéØ Key Features

### Smart Query Interpretation
- **Semantic Understanding**: Extracts the core topic from your query for vector similarity search
- **Metadata Filtering**: Automatically identifies and applies filters for authors, dates, tags, and more
- **Flexible Date Parsing**: Understands relative dates like "last year", "June 2023", "this month"

### Powered by AI
- **Google Gemini Integration**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for intelligent query parsing
- **Sentence Transformers**: Employs 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for high-quality text embeddings
- **Pinecone Vector DB**: Leverages serverless vector database for fast, scalable search

### User-Friendly Interface
- **Streamlit Web App**: Clean, intuitive interface for easy interaction
- **Real-time Results**: Instant query processing and result display
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust search parameters like top-k results
- **Data Upload**: Simple CSV to vector database pipeline

## üîç How It Works

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline
```
CSV Data ‚Üí JSON Conversion ‚Üí Embedding Generation ‚Üí Pinecone Format ‚Üí Vector Database
```

![Sample Data Structure](images/sample-data-csv.jpg)

The system processes your CSV data through several stages:
- Converts CSV to structured JSON format
- Generates title embeddings using sentence transformers
- Formats data for Pinecone with proper metadata structure
- Uploads vectors to your Pinecone index

### 2. Query Processing
When you ask a question like: *"Show me articles by Jane Doe from last year about machine learning"*

![Query Processing](images/query-interface.jpg)

The system:
- **Extracts Metadata Filter**: `{"author": "Jane Doe", "published_year": 2024, "tags": {"$in": ["machine learning"]}}`
- **Creates Semantic Query**: `"machine learning articles"`
- **Generates Embedding**: Converts semantic query to vector representation
- **Searches Database**: Combines vector similarity with metadata filtering
- **Returns Results**: Displays matched articles with full metadata

### 3. Supported Query Types

**Author-based Queries**:
- "Find articles by John Smith"
- "What did Alice Johnson write about AI?"

**Date-based Queries**:
- "Show me posts from last year"
- "Articles published in June 2023"
- "Recent content from this month"

**Topic-based Queries**:
- "Find content about vector databases"
- "Show me machine learning research"

**Combined Queries**:
- "Alice's articles about NLP from 2024"
- "Recent posts by Bob on deep learning"

### Initial Setup Workflow

#### Step 1: Configure Pinecone
![Pinecone Console](images/pinecone-console.jpg)
*Initial Pinecone console before creating any indexes*

When the Streamlit app opens, you'll see the Pinecone Configuration panel on the left sidebar:

- **Pinecone API Key**: Enter your Pinecone API key (get it from [Pinecone Console](https://app.pinecone.io))
- **Index Name**: Choose a name for your index (e.g., "demo", "mydemosp")
- **Similarity Metric**: Select your preferred metric (cosine recommended)
- **Vector Dimension**: Keep as **384** (matches the embedding model dimensions)

#### Step 2: Upload Your Data
![Streamlit Interface](images/streamlit-interface.jpg)
*Main Streamlit interface showing configuration options and upload functionality*

1. Ensure your CSV data follows the required schema:
   ```csv
   pageURL,title,publishedDate,author,tags
   https://example.com/article1,Sample Article,2025-05-01T14:25:03.000000Z,Akainu,"[""#SuyashSharma"", ""#RCB"", ""#CricketHealth""]"
   ```

2. Click **"üì¶ Upload Data to Pinecone"**

3. The system will process your data through several stages:
   - Convert CSV to JSON format (`output.json`)
   - Generate embeddings (`encoded_output.json`)
   - Format for Pinecone (`pinecone_data.json`)
   - Upload to your Pinecone index

4. You can verify the upload by checking:
   - **Local files**: JSON files will appear in your working directory
   - **Pinecone Console**: Your index will show the uploaded vectors

*Pinecone console showing successfully created index with uploaded data*

#### Step 3: Query Your Database
![Query Interface](images/query-interface.jpg)
*Query interface where users can input natural language questions*

1. **Enter your query** in natural language:
   - "Show me articles written by the author Akainu"
   - "Find posts about cricket from last year"
   - "What did Jane Doe write about IPL?"

2. **Provide credentials** (for security):
   - Enter your **API Key** again
   - Enter your **Index Name** again
   - Adjust **Number of results** (1-10)

3. **Run Query** and view results:
   - **Interpreted Query**: See how your natural language was converted to filters and semantic search
   - **Results**: Browse matched articles with full metadata

![Query Results](images/query-results.jpg)
*Example of query results with complete metadata and relevance scores*

### Example Data Structure
![Sample Data CSV](images/sample-data-csv.jpg)
*Example CSV data structure showing the required columns and format*

The system expects CSV data like this:
```csv
pageURL,title,publishedDate,author,tags
https://example.com/article1,Sample Article,2025-05-01T14:25:03.000000Z,Akainu,"[""#SuyashSharma"", ""#RCB"", ""#CricketHealth""]"
```

### Security Features
- **Double Authentication**: Users must enter API credentials twice (setup + query) for enhanced security
- **No Persistent Storage**: API keys are not stored in the application
- **Direct Index Access**: Queries go directly to your Pinecone index with your credentials

### Sample Query Examples
Based on the provided data, try these queries:
- "Show me articles written by the author Akainu"
- "Find cricket articles by Jane Doe from 2025"
- "What did Mary Poppins write about IPL?"
- "Show me recent articles about Vaibhav Suryavanshi"

### Troubleshooting
- **No Index Found**: Make sure you've uploaded data first and the index name matches
- **No Results**: Check if your query matches the available data and authors
- **API Errors**: Verify your Pinecone API key is valid and has proper permissions
- **Dimension Mismatch**: Ensure vector dimension is set to 384

The application will show you the interpreted query structure so you can understand how your natural language was processed into database filters and semantic search terms.
